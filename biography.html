            <p>Shakira is a hugely successfully Colombian pop singer and dancer and has won multiple Grammy, Latin Grammy and American Music Awards. Known for hits like "Whenever, Wherever" 
            and "Hips Don't Lie," Shakira is the highest-selling Colombian artist of all time, with estimates of more than 70 million albums sold worldwide. Additionally, she has served as a judge on the popular singing-competition show The Voice.
            Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll was born on February 2, 1977, in Barranquilla, Colombia. With a Lebanese father and Colombian mother, Shakira honors both her Latino and Arabic heritage in her music.
            She wrote her first song at the age of 8 and signed her first record deal at 13.</p>

        <h4><strong>Her history...</strong></h4>
         After her first two albums flopped, Shakira took the reins of her third album, becoming involved in every aspect of its production. Released in 1996, Pies Descalzos, meaning "bare feet," sold more than 3 million copies. The album 
         featured her trademark sound, a blend of Latin, rock and Arabic musical styles. Her follow-up record, Dónde Están Los Ladrones? (1998), which translates as "Where are the thieves?", reached the top of Billboard's Latin charts. 
         Not long after, Shakira won her first Grammy Award (best Latin pop album) for Shakira: MTV Unplugged (2000). 
         With the success of her albums, Shakira became a music superstar in the Spanish-language markets, known for her strong vocals and incredible hip-shaking belly dance moves.
         </p>
         <p>
            In 1998 Shakira released ¿Dónde están los ladrones?, which included several memorable singles. She notably won Latin Grammy Awards for best female pop vocal performance (“Ojos así”) and for best rock vocal performance (“Octavo día”). 
            She then focused her efforts on establishing herself in the American market. In 2001 her album MTV Unplugged (2000) won the Grammy Award for best Latin pop album, and she released her first English-language album, Laundry Service, that same year. 
            Although her English-language songwriting skills were questioned by some (Shakira wrote all her own lyrics), Laundry Service sold more than 13 million copies worldwide.

            Shakira continued her crossover success in 2005 with the release of the Spanish-language Fijación oral, vol. 1 in June and the English-language Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 in November.
            Both albums debuted in the top five in the United States, and her single “Hips Don’t Lie” (featuring Wyclef Jean) topped charts around the world in 2006. At that year’s Latin Grammy Awards, she captured song-of-the-year and record-of-the-year awards 
            for the single “La tortura,” and Fijación oral, vol. 1 was named album of the year as well as best female pop vocal album; it also won a Grammy Award for best Latin rock/alternative album. A live recording, Oral Fixation Tour, followed in 2007. 
            Also that year Shakira performed in Hamburg as part of Live Earth, a worldwide concert series organized to bring attention to climate change and environmental sustainability.

         <p>
            While hugely popular throughout much of the rest of the world, Shakira had not yet achieved a major record on the U.S. pop charts. In an attempt to increase her American fan base, in 1997, at the age of 20, the singer moved with
            her family to Miami, Florida, and taught herself to write songs in English. 
            There, she enlisted Emilio Estefan, of Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine fame, to act as her manager and producer.
            In 2001, Shakira released her first English-language album, Laundry Service, which quickly brought her the success in the United States she had been waiting for. The album reached No. 3 on the charts, selling more than 200,000 
            copies in its first week of release. Laundry Service's big hits included "Whenever, Wherever" and "Underneath Your Clothes."

            Shakira continued her crossover success in 2005 with the release of the Spanish-language Fijación oral, vol. 1 in June and the English-language Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 in November. Both albums debuted in the top five in the United States, and her single “Hips Don’t Lie” 
            (featuring Wyclef Jean) topped charts around the world in 2006. At that year’s Latin Grammy Awards, she captured song-of-the-year and record-of-the-year awards for the single “La tortura,” and Fijación oral, vol. 1 was named album of the year as well as best female pop vocal album; 
            it also won a Grammy Award for best Latin rock/alternative album. A live recording, Oral Fixation Tour, followed in 2007.

    <p> Shakira: The savage lyricist and prolific record breaker. On Friday, Guinness World Records announced that Shakira shattered several records on Spotify and Billboard charts, thanks to her 
        “BZRP Music Sessions Vol. 53” collaboration with Argentinian DJ Bizarrap.
        Among her broken records, “BZRP Music Sessions Vol. 53” — the scathing electropop banger aimed at her ex-husband Gerard Piqué — became the most-streamed Latin song on Spotify in both a 24-hour 
        and single-week timeframe. The track received 14.4 million streams in a single day, and 80.6 million streams in a week.
        Soon after the Guinness announcement, Sharika appeared on Tonight Show to perform “BZRP Music Sessions Vol. 53” to a hyped-up crowd:
    <br></br>
    “BZRP Music Sessions Vol. 53” also broke the record for fastest Latin track to reach 100 million views on YouTube after reaching the number in approximately 70 hours and broke the record for most views 
    in 24 hours with 63 million in a single day on YouTube. With the song, Shakira also became the first female vocalist to debut in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 with a Spanish song, and the first 
    female to replace herself at No. 1 on the Billboard Latin Airplay charts.
    <br></br>
    The song also helped Shakira break the record of Most Top 10 hits on both Billboard’s Hot Latin Songs and Latin Airplay charts by a female artist. Other accolades include swooping the record for most Billboard 
    charts topped by a Spanish-language song by a female artist and Most No. 1 hits on the Latin Airplay, Latin Pop Airplay, and Latin Digital Song Sales charts.
